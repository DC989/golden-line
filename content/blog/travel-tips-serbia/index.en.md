Serbia is a country rich in history, culture, and incredible gastronomy. Whether you're visiting for the first time or you're a returning traveler, these tips will help you make the most of your stay.

## 1. Currency and Payment

Serbia's official currency is the **Serbian Dinar (RSD)**. While major hotels and restaurants accept cards, many smaller venues and markets operate on cash only. We recommend always carrying dinars for small purchases.

- Exchange offices offer better rates than banks
- Avoid exchanging money at the airport — rates are unfavorable
- ATMs are widely available in cities

## 2. Getting Around

Serbia has a solid motorway network, but public transport can be limited outside major cities. For trips to popular destinations like Kopaonik or Zlatibor, a professional transfer service is the most comfortable option.

> **Pro tip:** Book your transfer in advance, especially during ski season when demand is high.

## 3. Local Cuisine You Must Try

Serbian cuisine is hearty and flavorful. Here's what you shouldn't miss:

- **Ćevapi** — Serbian classic, served with kajmak and flatbread
- **Pljeskavica** — the Serbian burger with character
- **Burek** — flaky pastry filled with meat, cheese, or spinach
- **Rakija** — the national spirit, be sure to try the homemade variety

## 4. Best Time to Visit

Every season in Serbia has its charm:

| Season | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Spring (Apr–May) | City tourism, nature in bloom |
| Summer (Jun–Aug) | Festivals (EXIT), river beaches |
| Autumn (Sep–Oct) | Wine season, mild temperatures |
| Winter (Dec–Feb) | Skiing at Kopaonik, New Year celebrations |

## 5. Useful Serbian Phrases

Locals appreciate when you try speaking their language:

- **Zdravo** — Hello
- **Hvala** — Thank you
- **Koliko košta?** — How much does it cost?
- **Molim vas** — Please
